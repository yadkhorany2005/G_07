## Role 6 ( Validation & Quality Assurance Lead)

There are two main concerns that we have found with the requirements

First of all is the accuracy of the assessments, most of the human traits can be linked to a certain mental disorder when they don’t even have the disorder themselves so by taking the test user might show some subtle signs of a disorder when they don’t actually have it making the test misleading and may cause discomfort for the user and may lead them to go down a rabbit hole that the website dug for them.

Secondly, Security and trust, the user data should be highly secured to prevent it from leaking, and strictly monitored by professionals or the web designers themselves. this process can boost the website’s popularity and gain the trust of users making it attract the attention of potential patients  and helping the vast majority of the human popularity giving the reassurance that they don’t have anything wrong with their mental status and if they do we will be guiding them towards the right path or at least help them begin their journey.

For our validation methods we will be using test cases, test case can help us set a  benchmark for the rest of the users  in order to see if the test actually works. Taking some samples and getting sample set of data to see if the test correlates with the results.
We'll get a person that has been diagnosed with a particular disorder that we have created a test for, then we will take their consent to take the test and see if they get our desired output, that will bring us confirmation that our test is successful therefore we can release for the public to benefit from it
